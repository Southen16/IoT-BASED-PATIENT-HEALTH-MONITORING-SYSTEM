# IoT-BASED-PATIENT-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM
The absence of competent medical facilities in a growing country like India has long been a
source of worry, particularly in distant communities. In rural areas, there is a lack of competent
medical care and diagnosis. This is mostly owing to the low doctor-to-patient ratio in these
locations. There is a need to improve patient care effectiveness. Improve the effectiveness of the
patient monitoring system. The existing patient monitoring system has one major flaw: the necessity
that the doctor is physically present in the room. It is not always practical to be near the patient.
Hence It becomes vital to create a system that does not rely on humans. Patient monitoring, require
the presence of the doctor. Because of developments in bio-instrumentation and bio-informatics
Because of advancements in telecommunications technology, it is now possible to create a
monitoring system by using IoT-based devices like Arduino, the ESP32 Wi-Fi module, LCD screen,
and others
This system can be very helpful for the continuous monitoring of the patient. A doctor can advise
the patient from the phone. This system has a low cost of implementation.
