# IoT-BASED-PATIENT-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM
The absence of competent medical facilities in a growing country like India has long been a
source of worry, particularly in distant communities. In rural areas, there is a lack of competent
medical care and diagnosis. This is mostly owing to the low doctor-to-patient ratio in these
locations. There is a need to improve patient care effectiveness. Improve the effectiveness of the
patient monitoring system. The existing patient monitoring system has one major flaw: the necessity
that the doctor is physically present in the room. It is not always practical to be near the patient.
Hence It becomes vital to create a system that does not rely on humans. Patient monitoring, require
the presence of the doctor. Because of developments in bio-instrumentation and bio-informatics
Because of advancements in telecommunications technology, it is now possible to create a
monitoring system by using IoT-based devices like Arduino, the ESP32 Wi-Fi module, LCD screen,
and others
This system can be very helpful for the continuous monitoring of the patient. A doctor can advise
the patient from the phone. This system has a low cost of implementation.

1.2 OBJECTIVE

The main aim of IoT based patient health monitoring system is to continuously track
and monitor patient Oxygen(SPO2), Pulse, Temperature and provide information to
doctors, nurses, and other caretakers it has an inbuilt keypad with default functions that
patients can use it and can take help in any emergency.

1.3 PROBLEM FORMULATION

In the absence of doctors, the patient is unable to consult them, potentially resulting in an
emergency scenario. Each person's particular health is being monitored.



1.4 SCOPE

Health Monitoring System can be operated and controlled either by a mobile phone or
manually from any location. This system makes it easy to check on the status of the patient
and also provides data for doctors, patients, nurses, and caretakers.
1.5 FEASIBILITY
A feasibility study is an analysis that considers all of a project's relevant factors
including economic, technical, legal, and scheduling considerations to ascertain the likelihood
of completing the project successfully.
